# Any Type

The "any" type in Terraform is a unique feature designed as a placeholder for a type that is yet to be determined. It doesn't inherently represent a specific type; instead, Terraform dynamically calculates the type during runtime when the "any" type is utilized.

```hcl
variable "any_example" {
    type    = any
    default = {
        field1 = "foo"
        field2 = "bar"
    }
}

output "any_example" {
    value = var.any_example
}
```

In this example, we define a variable named "any\_example" with the "any" type. By providing a default value during initialization, Terraform leverages this information to deduce the type of our "any\_example" variable. In this instance, Terraform infers the type as "object({ field1 = string, field2 = string})" based on the default values assigned.

The output statement then prints the "any\_example" variable, showcasing how Terraform dynamically determines and uses the inferred type. The flexibility of the "any" type allows for versatile use cases, where the exact type may vary, providing adaptability in certain scenarios where type determination is deferred until runtime.
