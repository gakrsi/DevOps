# Help Command

* Terraform has a built-in help system accessible from the command line.
* To get a list of commands, use either `terraform` without arguments or `terraform help`.
* To learn more about a specific command, use the format `terraform commandName -help`.
* Example: `terraform plan -help` provides a description and options for the `terraform plan` command.
* This helps discover additional options, enhancing flexibility and automation.
* Adding the `-help` flag to a command outputs instructions to stdout.
