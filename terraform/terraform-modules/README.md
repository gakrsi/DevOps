# Terraform Modules

A module in Terraform is a mini Terraform project that can contain all of the same constructs as our main Terraform project (resources, data blocks, locals, etc.). Modules are useful as they allow us to define a reusable block of Terraform code of which we can have many instances in our main Terraform project.
