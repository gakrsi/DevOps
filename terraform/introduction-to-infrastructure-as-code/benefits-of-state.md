# Benefits of State

Terraform uses a smart method called "state" to manage the creation and changes of resources. When you create a resource, like an EC2 instance in AWS, Terraform notes down essential details about it in the state, forming a map of resource metadata.

**Remote State Backend:** This state map serves various purposes, aiding in maintaining consistency between the desired and actual configurations. It enables idempotence, ensuring that only necessary changes are made to the environment during each configuration update.

**Dependency Tracking:** The state also helps in easily understanding dependencies between resources. If, for example, a subnet and an EC2 instance are removed from the configuration, Terraform, using the state, knows to remove the EC2 instance first as it depends on the subnet.

**Performance Enhancement:** In terms of performance, the state acts as a snapshot of the current infrastructure. Instead of querying resources directly for each change, Terraform refers to the state to decide if modifications are needed. This not only speeds up the planning process but also prevents performance degradation as the infrastructure scales.

**Collaboration Support:** The state also plays a crucial role in collaboration. It keeps track of configuration versions, supports state locking during updates, and when stored remotely, allows teams to work together without overwriting each other's contributions.

**Balancing Refresh and Performance:** While Terraform automatically refreshes the state, you can skip this step to improve performance. However, the risk lies in potential inconsistencies between the actual infrastructure and what's recorded in the state file. The decision to skip refresh should be carefully balanced against performance gains.

**Key takeaways:**&#x20;

Terraform state is the backbone that connects real-world instances to configuration resources. It enhances planning engine performance, aids in dependency tracking, and facilitates effective collaboration among teams.
