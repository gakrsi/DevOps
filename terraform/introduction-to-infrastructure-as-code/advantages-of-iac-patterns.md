# Advantages of IaC Patterns

**Advantages of Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

**1. Consistency:** Define infrastructure as code to ensure consistent deployment across various builds and environments. Using the same code for staging and production eliminates concerns about parity, fostering consistency in a cloud context, even across different regions.

**2. Repeatability:** IaC enables the definition of common components and deployment patterns once, allowing for reuse. For instance, web server deployments can be coded and easily replicated for new applications. Updates to configurations can be uniformly applied across multiple environments.

**3. Efficiency:** With infrastructure defined as code, operations teams seamlessly integrate with developers. The provisioning process becomes part of the application development workflow, creating a streamlined and repeatable process across development, QA, staging, and production. Automation and collaboration lead to enhanced efficiency.

**Key Takeaways:** IaC enhances consistency, repeatability, and efficiency, contributing to reduced risks and costs.
