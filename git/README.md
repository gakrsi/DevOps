# Git

Git works differently from other version control systems because it's distributed. When you create a Git repository, you get a complete copy of the entire repository, not just a link or a partial copy. While you can reference the original repository, itâ€™s not mandatory. In version control systems like Git, CVS, or SVN, these code databases are called repositories.
