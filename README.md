# Terraform

Key Features:

1. Declarative Configuration: Define your infrastructure requirements in a human-readable and version-controlled configuration file, allowing for easy collaboration and versioning.
2. Multi-Cloud Support: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, enabling you to seamlessly manage resources across diverse environments and avoid vendor lock-in.
3. Infrastructure Orchestration: Orchestrate complex infrastructure setups by specifying the relationships and dependencies between resources, ensuring a reliable and consistent deployment process.
4. State Management: Terraform maintains a state file that keeps track of the current infrastructure configuration, facilitating efficient updates and changes without unnecessary modifications.
5. Extensibility: Leverage a rich ecosystem of providers and modules to extend Terraform' s capabilities and integrate with a wide range of services and technologies.
6. Plan and Apply: Visualize the proposed changes before deployment with the "terraform plan" command, and then apply the changes confidently using "terraform apply," minimizing the risk of unintended modifications.
7. Collaboration and Automation: Foster collaboration among team members by storing Terraform configurations in version control systems. Integrate Terraform into CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure.
